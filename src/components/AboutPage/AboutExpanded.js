                <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                I grew up in the Azores, Portugal, an archipelago in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. I lived most of my life as an islander until I decided to move to sunny Lisbon. ‚òÄÔ∏è And over a year ago, I found myself embracing yet another city in a new country, Gothenburg, Sweden. Adapting to the cold? Well, it's still a work in progress!
                </p>

                <p className={classes.aboutText}>

                For the past six years, I've thrived as an account manager, connecting with people from around the globe and relishing every moment of it. But life has a funny way of leading us down unexpected paths. My journey took a turn when I was helping companies find developers for their innovative ideas and projects: it ignited a curiosity for coding and problem-solving. So, I took the plunge and completed a boot camp to become a full-stack developer. Now, I'm excited to start this new chapter, combining my love for communication with my newfound tech skills.
