                  Outside of coding and the kitchen, I'm all about diving into
                  hobbies that keep life interesting. I love <span className={classes.tags}>exploring
                    </span> â€“ whether
                  it's roaming through Sweden's stunning outdoors or uncovering
                  cozy corners in local cafes that feel like hidden gems.
                  And when I need a mental escape, you'll find me nose-deep in a
                  book.
